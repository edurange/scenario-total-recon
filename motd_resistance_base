Nmap has a variety of methods to scan ports. The most basic (and default for non-root users)
 port scan simply attempts to connect() to each port, which attempts to perform the 3-way 
handshake and make a connection. A slightly more sophisticated scan is the TCP SYN scan,
[ nmap -Ss host ] 
This scan sends an initial TCP packet with the SYN flag, but then does not respond to the
hosts SYN/AWK packet. While slightly less obvious than the TCP connect() scan, it doesn't
take much to figure out when this kind of scan is occuring.

To have a better chance of scanning undetected, it is better to use FIN, Null and 
Xmas Tree Scans.

The hosts in the range 10.0.233.34 - 38 have been configured to block some, but not all
stealth scans. Which scans work on which hosts?

To learn how to use these stealth scans, check out the man page or this helpful tutorial:

When you're done with that, head over to the Control Room -- the IP ends in .3
