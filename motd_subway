You find your way to the subway and head home, looking forward to some well-
deserved sleep. Suddently, you're jumped by five people with guns, and the leader
points a gun at your head. It's your best friend, Harry! Before he can pull the
trigger, you kick away the gun with a lightning-fast move. You defeat all five and
run back to your house. Everything is getting strange. How did you just do that?

"If I'm not me, who the hell am I?"

When you get home, more bad news. Your partner is not your partner, your memories
are fake, and now you're a wanted criminal. As if by magic, you recieve a call from
a man claiming to be your former special agent partner. He has a briefcase for you
waiting in an unmarked hotel room. Without another option, you go there.

In the suitcase you find a chache of spy supplies -- guns, fake passports, currency,
and most importantly, the secret earth-spaceport address, ${ip_address}. Strange that it
didn't appear on your subnet scan. Could it be hidden somehow? Only your newly
discovered spy skills can get you the truth. Find the open port and get there!

Useful commands: man, nmap, ssh -p port_number user@ip_address
