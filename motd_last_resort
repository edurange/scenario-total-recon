Things don't go quite as hoped at the Last Resort. When you get there, you find a firefight has
broken out between the rebels and the (not so) secret police. Gunshuts fly everywhere! The tide
turns against the rebels, and you find yourself naturally fighting on their side. You defend the
cause with all you're worth, but it comes time to cut your losses and escape. You need to find your
way to the Resistance Base! But in the course of the battle, you've lost your spy scanning tool!

It's gone! nmap is gone! NOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Too bad. Such is a spy's luck. You'll have to make due without.

Find some other way to scan the Resistance Base at 10.0.234.8 to find a a way in.
ssh to the only port open

Helpful commands: nmap (you wish), nc, man nc
