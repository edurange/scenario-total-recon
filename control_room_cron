# Planning doc for cron job and the end script

# I believe the cron job should be pretty simple. It should be set to run a script every minute.

# This should be the cron entry in every user's crontab
# No, this will need to be run as root, nvm
# So in the system crontab:

* * * * * root /root/countdown

# Will run this script as root every minute

# THE SCRIPT ITSELF

# Now, things the script should do...

# Check / create the environmental variable $COUNTDOWN
# setenv will do this, and getenv can reference them
# Not sure if this is necessary at all

if $COUNTDOWN==5
   do 

if $COUNTDOWN < 5 
   do COUNTDOWN=$COUNTDOWN+1
done
