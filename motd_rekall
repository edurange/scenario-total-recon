You're in luck; you found a way in. You're directed to a chair and strapped
down. Selecting a beautiful dream for implantation, you prepare for a much
earned vacation. But wait! Something's wrong... You break into a violent rage,
screaming about your blown cover and the deaths of your comrades! The director
of Rekall Inc. tries to calm you, but you yell "My name is not Quaid!".
